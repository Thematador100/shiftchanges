## CRITICAL ALERTS: 3-5 ISSUES THAT WILL CAUSE REJECTION

*This is the most important section. Fixing these issues is your highest priority.*

**1. 🚨 RED ALERT: [CRITICAL ISSUE #1]**
   - **Problem:** [e.g., The budget justification does not match the budget line items. This is an automatic disqualifier.]
   - **Location:** [e.g., Page 12, Section 4.2]
   - **AI Recommendation:** [e.g., Re-calculate all budget line items and ensure the narrative justification for each expense matches the numbers exactly. We recommend adding a 'cost-per-person-served' metric.]

**2. 🚨 RED ALERT: [CRITICAL ISSUE #2]**
   - **Problem:** [e.g., The project outcomes are not measurable. Phrases like "improve well-being" are too vague.]
   - **Location:** [e.g., Page 5, Section 2.1]
   - **AI Recommendation:** [e.g., Replace vague outcomes with SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). Instead of "improve well-being," use "Increase participant-reported well-being scores by 15% over 12 months as measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale." ]

**3. ⚠️ YELLOW ALERT: [CRITICAL ISSUE #3]**
   - **Problem:** [e.g., The narrative fails to connect emotionally with the problem. It is too academic.]
   - **Location:** [e.g., Introduction, Page 2]
   - **AI Recommendation:** [e.g., Insert a 1-paragraph case study or a powerful statistic at the beginning to frame the problem in human terms. Use the "Problem-Agitate-Solve" framework to create urgency.]

## SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

### Narrative & Storytelling (Score: [X]/20)

- **Strengths:** [e.g., Clear description of the problem.]
- **Weaknesses:** [e.g., Lacks a compelling story of an individual helped by your work.]
- **AI Suggestion:** [e.g., Weave the story of one specific beneficiary throughout the narrative to serve as a common thread. Show, don't just tell.]

### Impact & Outcomes (Score: [X]/20)

- **Strengths:** [e.g., Ambitious goals.]
- **Weaknesses:** [e.g., No clear plan for how outcomes will be measured and reported.]
- **AI Suggestion:** [e.g., Add a "Monitoring & Evaluation" subsection that details the specific tools (surveys, interviews, data tracking) you will use and the frequency of reporting.]

### Budget & Financials (Score: [X]/20)

- **Strengths:** [e.g., The budget is reasonable for the proposed work.]
- **Weaknesses:** [e.g., Indirect costs are not clearly explained or justified.]
- **AI Suggestion:** [e.g., Add a short paragraph explaining your federally negotiated indirect cost rate (NICRA) or, if you don't have one, detailing the specific administrative costs covered by the indirect line item.]
