# OSINT-BASED CUSTOMER ACQUISITION PLAYBOOK

**The Real Way to Find Starving Crowds with Actual Contact Information**

---

## THE PRINCIPLE

Reddit and LinkedIn are NOT acquisition channels. They are time sinks. The real way to find desperate buyers is through **public records** that reveal:

1. **WHO** is in distress (name, address)
2. **WHAT** their problem is (bankruptcy, foreclosure, tax lien, lawsuit)
3. **HOW** to contact them (phone, email, mailing address)

2. **County Tax Records** - Tax delinquent property owners (about to lose everything)
3. **UCC Filings** - Businesses borrowing against assets (cash flow crisis)
4. **Court Records** - People being sued (need help NOW)

**Use paid tools like PropertyRadar or Tracers to get contact information instantly.** The $99-$299/month is worth it compared to hours of manual skip tracing.

**Your offer must match their desperation.** Don't sell "coaching" to someone about to lose their house. Sell them a solution to their immediate crisis.
