# $10K TODAY ACTION PLAN - December 18, 2025

## THE SITUATION
- 13 days until December 31, 2025

## PLAY #1: EQUIPMENT MATCHMAKER (Highest Probability)

### The Secret
Equipment dealers have inventory they MUST move before year-end. Business owners need to buy equipment to reduce taxes. Neither side can find each other fast enough. You become the bridge.

### The Math
- Equipment dealer has $500K in inventory they need to move
- Business owner needs to spend $200K to offset profits
- You connect them
- Charge 2-5% finder's fee = $4,000-$10,000

### Who's Starving

**Equipment Dealers (Sellers):**
- John Deere dealers with used equipment
- Construction equipment dealers
- Medical/dental equipment suppliers
- Restaurant equipment suppliers
- IT/computer equipment resellers

**Business Owners (Buyers):**
- Construction companies with unexpected profits
- Medical/dental practices
- Restaurants expanding
- Manufacturing companies
- Trucking companies
- Farmers with good harvest years

### The Free Solve
Create a "Section 179 Equipment Matching Report" for a specific industry:
- List available equipment in their area
- Calculate their potential tax savings
- Show them exactly what they could buy and how much they'd save

### Outreach Script (To Equipment Dealers)

> Subject: I have buyers looking for [equipment type] before Dec 31
>
> I work with business owners who need to make Section 179 purchases before year-end. Several of my clients are looking for [specific equipment type] and need to close before December 31.
>
> Do you have any inventory you're looking to move? I can connect you with qualified buyers today.
>
> If you have equipment available, reply with your inventory list and I'll match you with buyers.

### Outreach Script (To Business Owners)

> Subject: Save $[X] on your 2025 taxes - deadline Dec 31
>
> I noticed [trigger - e.g., your recent project win / your expansion / industry growth].
>
> If you have equipment needs for 2026, buying before December 31 could save you up to 100% of the purchase price in tax deductions.
>
> I've compiled a list of available [equipment type] in your area with dealers ready to close before year-end.
>
> Would a quick call today help you capture these savings?

## PLAY #2: YEAR-END BOOKKEEPING RESCUE

## KEY INSIGHT

The money is NOT in the service itself. The money is in:
1. **Knowing the deadline exists** (most people don't)
2. **Knowing who's desperate** (dealers with inventory, owners with tax liability)
3. **Being the bridge** between two parties who need each other

You're not selling equipment. You're not doing bookkeeping. You're selling **urgency resolution** and **connection**.

---

## TOOLS NEEDED

1. **Phone/Email** - for outreach
2. **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** (optional) - for finding business owners
3. **Section 179 Calculator** - create a simple spreadsheet showing tax savings
4. **Local equipment dealer list** - Google "[industry] equipment dealer [city]"

---

## GO NOW

The clock is ticking. Every hour that passes is an hour closer to December 31. The desperation increases daily. Act today.
