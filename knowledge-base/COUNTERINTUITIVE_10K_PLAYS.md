# COUNTERINTUITIVE $10K PLAYS - December 18, 2025

## THE PHILOSOPHY (Al Ries + Gary Halbert + Jon Benson)

> "The best way to get rich is to find a starving crowd and feed them." — Gary Halbert

> "The essence of positioning is sacrifice. You must be willing to give up something in order to establish that unique position." — Al Ries

> "People don't buy products. They buy better versions of themselves." — Jon Benson

**Our Formula:**
1. Find the starving crowd (desperation, not logic)
2. Own a category in their mind (positioning)
3. Demonstrate power by solving part of the problem for free (engineering as marketing)
4. They come to us (inbound, not outbound)
5. AI does the work (leverage)

### The Secret Most Don't Know
There are **46+ grant opportunities closing in the next 4-6 weeks** with deadlines between December 29, 2025 and January 31, 2026. Organizations scrambling to submit are desperate for help. Most grant writers are booked or on holiday.

## PLAY #2: GENEALOGY BRICK WALL BREAKER

### The Secret Most Don't Know

### The Starving Crowd

- Those with DNA matches they can't figure out
- People trying to document lineage for inheritance, citizenship, or tribal enrollment
- Those racing against time (elderly relatives with memories)

## PLAY #3: FORECLOSURE AUCTION INTELLIGENCE

### The Secret Most Don't Know
Foreclosure activity is UP 26% year-over-year. Auctions are happening daily. But most investors don't know:

### The Starving Crowd

- Investors who keep getting outbid and don't know why

## PLAY #4: TARIFF REFUND FINDER

## THE EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### Step 1: Choose ONE Play
Don't try all five. Pick the one where:
- You have the most knowledge/credibility
- You can deliver the Free Solve fastest
- The audience is most accessible to you

### Step 2: Create the Free Solve
Use AI to build the template/tool that delivers the free analysis. This is your "engineering as marketing."

### Step 3: Find 10 Desperate People
Go where they congregate. Look for language like:
- "Desperate"
- "Need help ASAP"
- "Running out of time"
- "Tried everything"
- "Will pay anything"

### Step 4: Deliver the Free Solve
Don't pitch. Don't sell. Just solve part of their problem. Let the quality speak.

### Step 5: Let Them Ask for More
If the Free Solve is good enough, they'll ask: "Can you do the rest?"

That's when you quote the full service.

## THE POSITIONING STATEMENT (Al Ries Framework)

For each play, complete this:

**For [target audience] who [have this problem], [your service] is the [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe].**

## REMEMBER

> "Fear drives the path of reason." — Your Philosophy

These people aren't buying services. They're buying relief from fear:
- Fear of missing the deadline
- Fear of never finding their ancestor
- Fear of losing money at auction
- Fear of leaving money on the table
- Fear of giving a meaningless gift

**Sell the relief. Deliver the solution.**
