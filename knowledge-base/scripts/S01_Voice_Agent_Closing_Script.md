_# Script S01: Voice Agent Closing Script (AI or Human)

## 1. Principle

This script is the verbal execution of our entire strategy. It is designed to be used by either a human sales agent (supported by AI) or a fully autonomous AI voice agent. The language is direct, confident, and empathetic. It moves the prospect from a state of fear to a state of certainty in under 5 minutes. Every word is intentional and tested.

## 2. The Script

**Context:** The prospect has responded to our outreach and this is the first live conversation.

--- 

**(Opening - Acknowledge & Align)**

**You:** "Hi [Prospect Name], this is [Your Name]. I'm the one who sent you the email regarding the [Distress Signal - e.g., tax lien] filed on [Date]. I know you weren't expecting my call. Is this a terrible time?"

*(Note: Using "terrible time?" is a pattern interrupt from Chris Voss's "Never Split the Difference." It makes them feel in control and usually elicits a "no, it's fine.")*

**Prospect:** (Responds)

--- 

**(Positioning - Establish Authority & Intent)**

**You:** "Great. I'll be brief. My firm and I do one thing: we solve [Specific Problem - e.g., complex IRS tax issues] for [Specific Profile - e.g., business owners] in your exact situation. I looked at your case, and I believe we can help. My only goal for this call is to see if you're a fit for what we do. Are you open to that?"

**Prospect:** (Agrees)

--- 

**(Qualification - The Motivation Filter)**

**You:** "Okay. So, just to be direct, are you actively looking to resolve this situation now, or are you just in the information-gathering phase? We're a bit overwhelmed at the moment, so we can only take on clients who are ready to take action."

*(Note: This is the critical step that flips the dynamic. It frames you as the prize and filters out tire-kickers. It creates scarcity and urgency.)*

**Prospect:** (Confirms they are serious)

--- 

**(The Offer - Certainty & Clarity)**

**You:** "Perfect. Then here is how we work. Based on your situation, we have one offer. It is: **[State the full Outcome-Based Offer from Framework F03]**."

*(Example: "We will reduce your IRS debt by at least 50% within the next 90 days, or our fee is fully refunded.")*

**You:** "The investment for that guaranteed result is [Price]."

**(PAUSE. Do not say anything else. Let them process it. The first person to speak loses.)**

--- 

**(Objection Handling - Re-framing, Not Arguing)**

*(This is where the AI-Assist for humans shines, or where the autonomous AI pulls from its knowledge base. The goal is to pivot back to the cost of inaction.)*

**Objection 1: "It's too expensive."**

**You:** "I understand. It's a significant investment. But right now, the [Problem - e.g., IRS] says you owe [Full Amount]. The cost of doing nothing is [Full Amount] plus penalties and interest. Our fee is a fraction of that, and it's for a guaranteed reduction. The real question isn't whether you can afford to do this, but whether you can afford to do nothing."

**Objection 2: "I need to think about it."**

**You:** "I can appreciate that. But the [Distress Signal] was filed on [Date], and every day that passes, [Negative Consequence - e.g., the penalties and interest grow / the foreclosure auction gets closer]. The free analysis I sent you shows a clear path forward. What specifically do you need to think about so I can provide clarity?"

**Objection 3: "Can you do it for less?"**

**You:** "That's a fair question. Unfortunately, no. We charge for the guaranteed result, not the process. The price is tied to the outcome. We take on all the risk, and our fee is fixed to ensure we can deliver on that guarantee."

--- 

**(The Close - Assume the Sale)**

**You:** "So, does the idea of having this problem solved in [Timeframe] with a full guarantee make sense to you?"

**Prospect:** "Yes."

**You:** "Excellent. Then the next step is simple. I'm going to send you the engagement letter right now. It outlines everything we just discussed. Once you sign that, we'll process the initial investment, and our team will have the [First Action - e.g., IRS Power of Attorney] filed this afternoon. What's the best email to send that to?"

**(Get the email, send the document, and guide them through to payment. The sale is not complete until cash is collected.)**

--- 

This script is a machine. It is designed to be executed consistently and without deviation. It respects the prospect's intelligence while guiding them to the logical conclusion: that our offer is the safest, most certain path out of their crisis.
