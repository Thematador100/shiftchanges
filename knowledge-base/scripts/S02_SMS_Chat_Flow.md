_# Script S02: SMS Chat Flow (AI-Powered)

## 1. Principle

This script governs our automated SMS conversations. It is designed for speed, clarity, and moving the prospect from the initial outreach to a scheduled call or a direct sale. The tone is professional but slightly more casual than email. Every message is designed to elicit a simple, one-word response to keep the conversation moving.

## 2. The Flow

**Context:** This flow begins 24 hours after the initial email outreach if there has been no reply.

--- 

**Message 1: The Nudge**

**AI:** `Hi [Prospect Name], this is [Your Name]. I sent you an email yesterday with an analysis regarding the [Distress Signal]. Did you have a chance to see it?`

* **Goal:** Get a simple "yes" or "no." Confirm the email was seen.

--- 

**Path A: Prospect responds "No" or "I didn't see it."**

**AI:** `No problem. I can resend it. What's the best email? Just want to make sure you see the analysis - it shows a clear path to resolving the [Problem].`

* **Goal:** Re-engage, confirm email, and reiterate the value of the Free Solve.

--- 

**Path B: Prospect responds "Yes."**

**AI:** `Great. The analysis shows you have a strong case for [Specific Outcome]. Did you have 2 minutes to discuss the options?`

* **Goal:** Transition from the Free Solve to a live conversation.

--- 

**Path C: Prospect responds positively to discussing options ("Yes," "Okay," "Sure").**

**AI:** `Excellent. Are you free now for a brief call, or is later today better?`

* **Goal:** Schedule the call for immediate transfer to a closing agent (human or AI).

--- 

**Path D: Prospect is hesitant or asks for more info via text.**

**Prospect:** `Just send me the info.`

**AI:** `I can do that. In short, our offer is to [State Outcome-Based Offer concisely]. The investment is [Price]. It's a guaranteed result. A quick call can clarify everything, but if you're ready now, I can send a secure link to get started.`

* **Goal:** Attempt to close directly via text by presenting the full offer and a path to payment. This is for highly motivated, low-friction buyers.

--- 

**Path E: Prospect asks "Is this a sales call?" or is skeptical.**

**AI:** `Fair question. This is not a sales call. I'm a specialist in [Problem]. The analysis I sent is real. If you want to solve the problem, we can help. If not, no pressure at all. Would a 5-minute call to review the findings be helpful?`

* **Goal:** Disarm skepticism by re-framing as a helpful consultation, not a sales pitch.

--- 

**Path F: No response after Message 1.**

*(Wait 48 hours)*

**AI (Message 2):** `[Prospect Name], following up one last time. The deadline to act on the [Distress Signal] is approaching. We've helped others in your situation achieve [Specific Result]. If you want help, let me know. Otherwise, I won't contact you again.`

* **Goal:** Create urgency and use the "takeaway" close. This is the final automated message.

## 3. Implementation Notes

-   **CRM Integration:** Every message sent and received must be logged in the central CRM.
-   **Keyword Triggers:** The AI must be programmed to recognize keywords (e.g., "stop," "unsubscribe") to comply with regulations, and keywords like "call me" or "interested" to immediately route to a closing agent.
-   **Human Takeover:** A human operator should be able to take over any conversation at any time from a central dashboard.

This SMS flow acts as a powerful, automated follow-up and qualification system, ensuring that the leads generated by our outreach are nurtured efficiently toward a close.
